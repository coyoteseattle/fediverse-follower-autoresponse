# Fediverse Follower Autoresponder
This is a simple script to automatically send DMs to anyone who sends you a follow request.

Prerequisites:  
python 2.7 (May work on others, I can't guarantee it.)  
Mastodon.py (pip install mastodon.py)  
An account on a Mastodon, Pleroma, or other fediverse server with a compatible client URL.  

Installation:  
Clone or download it somewhere, make sure you have all the prereqs, then run follow_autoresponder.py.  It will walk you through setup and authentication, then store your config in ~/.fedifollowautoresponder.
